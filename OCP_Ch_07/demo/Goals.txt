    IDEA 1
	Compare execution time for a for loop, a stream and a parallel stream.

	Test Data:
		List of 10 Strings
		List of 1000 Strings
		List of 100000 Strings
		List of 10000000 Strings
		List of 1000000000 Strings

    IDEA 2
    Write a matrix-multiplying algorithm. Parallelize it. Optimize it. See how it scales especially if you have a multi-core machine.

    IDEA 3
    Write a matrix-adding algorithm. Test it's performance parallelized vs linear.
